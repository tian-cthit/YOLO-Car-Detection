# YOLO-Car-Detection

## An YOLO implementation using keras and tensorflow.
The YOLO model comes from YAD2K, addintional functions includnig non maximum suppression is implemented.

Sample output:

## References:
The implementation is based on the machine learning course from deeplearning.ai.
The ideas presented came primarily from the two YOLO papers. The implementation here also took significant inspiration and used many components from Allan Zelener's github repository. The pretrained weights used in this exercise came from the official YOLO website.
